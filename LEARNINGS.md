# Learnings

This document captures how my thinking and decision-making improved while using AI during this project.

---

## 1. Improved Critical Evaluation
I became more deliberate about not accepting AI output at face value.  
Instead of asking “does this work?”, I now ask:
- Is this scalable?
- Does this fit my design system?
- Will this break later?

---

## 2. Better UX Judgment
AI often solves technical problems but misses UX nuance.  
This project reinforced the importance of:
- Reducing cognitive load (one FAQ open at a time)
- Slowing down animations for readability
- Making interaction areas forgiving on mobile

---

## 3. Clearer Separation Between Structure and Styling
I improved at identifying when AI mixes concerns (layout, style, behavior).  
I now consciously separate:
- Semantic HTML
- Visual styling
- Interaction logic

This made refactoring easier and reduced technical debt.

---

## 4. Stronger Prompt Discipline
I learned that vague prompts produce generic solutions.
More specific constraints (animation speed, interaction rules, visual intent)
lead to outputs that require less correction.

---

## 5. AI as an Assistant, Not a Designer
The biggest improvement was mindset-related:
- AI accelerates implementation
- Design judgment remains human-led

Using AI effectively means knowing when to override it.
